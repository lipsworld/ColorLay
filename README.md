ColorLay
========

Tiny JS library (3KB minified) to apply color overlay effects on images, by using CSS classes. Eight color overlay effects available: dark, white, blue, red, green, yellow, purple, orange.

## Usage

Include the class for the desired color inside the IMG tag, using the format "overlay-[color]", and that's it. If you prefer the overlay to be just triggered when the image is hovered, just use the class using the format "overlay-[color]-hover".
