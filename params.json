{"name":"Colorlay.js","tagline":"Tiny JS to apply color overlay effects on images, by using CSS classes","body":"### ColorLay.js.\r\nAn easy way to apply color overlay filter on images in a website.\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\nDownload the library **ColorLay.js** or the minified version ColorLay.min.js and load it before the </BODY> tag in your code. Be sure that you have a recent version of JQuery loaded.\r\n\r\nThe library also appends the necessary styles in CSS to run the overlay effect, so don't worry about it.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nInclude the class for the desired color inside the IMG tag, using the format \"overlay-[color]\", and that's it. If you prefer the overlay to be just triggered when the image is hovered, just use the class using the format **\"overlay-[color]-hover\"**. This library depends on Jquery, so be sure you have it included, preferably in a recent version.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\nSome examples of the effect can be found in our framework's website - Rubber Framework. Be in touch if you find any bug or need any help while using it. Enjoy!.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis library is free to use, copy, modify...  credit is not mandatory, but much appreciated: @Startupeando or Carlos Matos 2013.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
